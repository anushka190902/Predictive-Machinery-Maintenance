## Workflow

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Utilized machinery sensor data, operational parameters, and maintenance logs.
   - Common features included temperature, vibration levels, pressure, and usage time.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handled missing values, outliers, and noise in the dataset.
   - Scaled and normalized features where required.
   - Engineered additional features such as rolling averages and thresholds for better predictive power.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualized correlations between features and failure events.
   - Identified patterns in sensor readings preceding failures.

4. **Model Building**:
   - Implemented three key algorithms:
     - **Logistic Regression**: For baseline binary classification.
     - **Random Forest**: To handle non-linear relationships and feature importance.
     - **XGBoost**: For high-performance predictions with fine-tuned hyperparameters.
   - Split data into training and testing sets to evaluate performance.

5. **Evaluation**:
   - Used metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
   - Assessed models for their predictive reliability and generalization ability.

6. **Deployment**:
   - Built a reusable pipeline for real-time predictive maintenance insights.
